            The first permanent settlement of American Falls was founded in 1800. It was located on the West back of the Snake river, which is the opposite side of the river that the current town is on!
            The town was moved in 1888 to the other side of the river, but that was not the last time it moved. <br><br>
            In 1925 the town was moved again! It was moved to make way for the American Falls Dam. They were able to move, all residents (344), 46 businesses, three hotels, one school, five churches,
            one hospital, six grain elevators, and one flour mill! The new city was placed on higher ground. By doing this they were able to better plan and organize the town as a whole.
            Now there would be a park in the center of the town, streets wer laid out diagonally and parallel to the reservoir shore. The city planners wanted the city to be laid out so that the sun could sine in every window.
            I promise you it does!<br><br>

        <h3>American Falls Today</h3>
        <p>
            Today American Falls is still going strong! The only structure that can still be seen standing, within the reservoir, is the old grain elevator. No matter how high the water gets it is still visible, standing tall above the water. A reminder of where the town used to be. 
            Fun fact, towards the end of the summer and into harvest time, when the reservoir is really low, you can walk out and see some of the old foundations of the buildings that were left behind.<br><br>
            The younger grades take a field trip out each year to see the remains if the water level is low enough.
